title: Hosting Mail Server di DigitalOcean dan Block Port 25
---

## Pendahuluan

Bagi pelanggan baru DigitalOcean, Droplet (sebutan instance VPS) yang didapat akan otomatis terblokir port 25.

## Penjelasan Resmi

Penjelasan Resmi baru muncul di tahun 2021:

> Why is SMTP blocked?
>
> Validated on 11 January 2021 â€¢ Posted on 11 January 2021
>
> SMTP port 25 is blocked on all Droplets for some new accounts to prevent spam and other abuses of our platform. To send mail on these accounts, use a dedicated email deliverability platform (such as Sendgrid and Mailgun), which are better at handling deliverability factors like IP reputation.
> Even on accounts where SMTP is available, we recommend against running your own mail server in favor of using a dedicated email deliverability platform.

## Test Port 25

Misalnya IP kita adalah `206.189.94.130`, maka eksekusi command sbb:

```
telnet 206.189.94.130 25
```

Jika berhasil, maka akan muncul output sebagai berikut:

```
Trying 206.189.94.130...
Connected to 206.189.94.130.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 server1.systemix.id ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
```

Keluar dengan command `quit`. Output:

```
quit
221 2.0.0 Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
